# BlacklightFramework
BlacklightFramework is a framework of tools created for and used in the development of Blacklight Software. Mostly all of the modules in this project were only mostly finished and were not fully polished, some more than others. For example, the virtual architecture implementation does not support any trap codes as outlined in the documentation, and x86 calls are only supported on 32-bit Windows, though extendability should not be difficult. Detouring has some limitations on 64-bit, namely creating a trampoline which includes relative addressing over 0x7FFFFFFF bytes away. Otherwise, it is tested to be pretty stable on 32-bit. I never had intentions of releasing this project, but as the associated software's development is no longer apparent I think it is more well-suited for the public domain. All of the code is cross-platform.
